# 🍽️ Elysian Table

**Elysian Table** is a fictional Greek restaurant website built using **HTML** and **CSS**, with a focus on elegant styling and a clean, responsive layout — entirely without JavaScript.

This project was created in my free time as a hands-on way to apply foundational HTML and CSS concepts. It served both as a creative outlet and a practical exercise in layout structuring, responsive design, and visual aesthetics.
